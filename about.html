			<h2>Why did we build this?</h2>
			<p>Good question. Have you ever been at RIT and been hungry, but you don't know where to go or if your favorite restaurant is open? Well, we have. And this happens more than you'd think. Constantly after a late class we would be looking for somewhere to go for a late dinner and it can sometimes be tougher than it sounds. Also, when Nate is giving tours, people would constantly ask where a good place to get a meal on campus would be. After the third time of sending someone to a place that is closed, Nate felt pretty awful and needed a better way to answer this common question. So, Hungry Tiger was born.</p>

			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p>This app is created using HTML5 and Javascript. All of our data is gathered by RIT's web service and we utilize <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/">Google Maps</a> for the location of each restaurant. Using Javascript's Date function, we are able to determine the exact time that the user is viewing the app, which through various conversions and comparisons, allows us to determine which food places on campus are open. This way you can avoid the problem of walking to a restaurant that is no longer open at that time.</p>
			
			<h2>What cool technologies does it use?</h2>
			<p>One of the cool web technologies that we use is local storage. We use this ability to save a users preference of showing or hiding the logos for each restaurant. Overall, the use of HTML5 and CSS3 allows us to add some cool effects without more Javascript or jQuery. For eaxmples, CSS3 transitions help make the various clickable items on the app change as the user interacts with them. </p>
